# Features

A Simple PHP Chat with Long Polling.

No database is used. Data is saved in a text file. The number of stored messages is limited to a specified number. 
The server is polled for new messages from the moment the most recent one is displayed in the browser. 
In order to simplify the logic, all stored messages are sent.
